  *Whenever we lose in life, it feels like the saddest moment but a wise man has said losses teach us more than wins.* 
  </p>&nbsp;
  
<p align="center">
  
  *So, I dont see my defeats as just a loss rather I see them as an opportunity to learn. You either win or learn, you never lose. Self analyse where you went wrong and improve, that's what is life according to me.* 
  </p>&nbsp;
  
  <p> 
  
  *Adversities are part of life, it makes us strong. Accept them and be more ready for the them the next time.*
